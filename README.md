Experimental WIP.

The goal is to clean up some of the code in
[ec-policies](https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies) related to
extracting tekton task information from different format SLSA attestations and
make it easier to maintain, test and debug.

This might get folded back in to ec-policies, or it might become its own
separate library.
